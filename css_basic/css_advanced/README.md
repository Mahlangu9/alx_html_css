# Advanced CSS Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, focusing on advanced CSS techniques. The objective is to replicate a Figma design with precise styling and structure using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Master layout and styling using advanced CSS
- Work directly from a Figma design file
- Use only native web technologies (no external libraries or frameworks)
- Ensure W3C-compliant HTML and CSS
- Reuse styles efficiently with custom properties (CSS variables)
- Handle font imports, image assets, and design tokens

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Figma (for design reference)

## 🖼 Design File

Figma design available here: [Figma Project Link](#)

## 📝 Notes
